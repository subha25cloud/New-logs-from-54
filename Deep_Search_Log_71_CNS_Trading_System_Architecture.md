**Title:** Three-Layer CNS Trading System Architecture Blueprint

Synopsis: This blueprint presents a cinematic breakdown of a three-layer algorithmic trading system inspired by a "Central Nervous System (CNS)" design. The system is organized into an ML Layer for market analysis, a Bot Layer for strategy execution, and a CNS Layer for decision-making and risk management. We detail the modular file structure, Python-style pseudocode for each module (with inline explanations), the logic flow of each layer, signal and conflict resolution mechanisms, and notes on future expansions (voice commands, GPT-agent integration, mobile/web UI). Finally, we walk through a complete trade lifecycle from initial analysis to final trade execution, with logging and manual override considerations. The goal is a clear, developer-friendly guide to building this system module by module.
